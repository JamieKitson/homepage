--- Setup ---

Smiley is packaged to set up on your own server. To configure Smiley,
follow these steps .

1) Create a new application at
(http://www.facebook.com/developers/). The only fields that you need
to give are application name and an app.facebook.com/{APP_SUFFIX}
url. The app will configure the rest.

2) Copy the file config/settings.ini.sample to config/settings.ini. Fill
out your ROOT_LOCATION, APP_SUFFIX, API_KEY, and SECRET_KEY in the settings
file, making sure ROOT_LOCATION includes a trailing forward slash.

3) From the command line, run 'php config/setup.php' which will set your app
settings and create your feed templates.

You're good to go!
